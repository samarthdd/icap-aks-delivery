```

### Install ArgoCD CLI tool

You can interact with ArgoCD through the CLI or the gui. To install the cli tool, follow the below instructions:

VERSION=$(curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name"' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
```

Next use curl to download the most recent Linux version:

```bash
curl -sSL -o /usr/local/bin/argocd https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/download/$VERSION/argocd-linux-amd64
